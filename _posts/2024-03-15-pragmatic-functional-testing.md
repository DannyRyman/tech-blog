# **Pragmatic Unit Testing: A Practical Approach**

Unit testing is a crucial part of modern software development, ensuring that systems behave as expected from an external consumer’s perspective. This article explores a **pragmatic approach to unit testing**—one that prioritizes **testing observable behavior over implementation details**, avoiding excessive mocking while still maintaining speed and reliability.

## **A Philosophy of Realism in Testing**
Rather than focusing on isolated, white-box unit tests or costly full end-to-end (E2E) tests, this approach emphasizes **unit testing at the API boundary** while minimizing unnecessary stubbing and mocking. The goal is to verify that the system produces the correct **outcomes** rather than testing its internal structure.

### **Key Principles of This Approach**

1. **Unit Testing via Public APIs Using an xUnit Framework**  
   - Tests interact with the system through a **single API endpoint**, mirroring real consumer interactions rather than orchestrating multiple endpoints.  
   - The application runs **in-memory** during tests, leveraging built-in test modes supported by modern web frameworks. For example, Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, and Django all provide mechanisms to start lightweight instances without requiring full external infrastructure.  
   - Example: Using Spring Boot, a functional test can be set up with `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)`, which starts the application in-memory and allows API requests via a `WebTestClient`:
   
     ```kotlin
     @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
     @RunWith(SpringRunner::class)
     class MyApiTest(@Autowired val webTestClient: WebTestClient) {
     
         @Test
         fun `should return expected response from API`() {
             webTestClient.get().uri("/api/example")
                 .exchange()
                 .expectStatus().isOk
                 .expectBody<String>().value { body ->
                     assertTrue(body.contains("expected content"))
                 }
         }
     }
     ```  

2. **Stubbing External Services, Not Internal Components**  
   - **Third-party integrations** are stubbed to ensure the system under test operates in isolation.  
   - However, internal services are **not** mocked—allowing real interactions between components to be tested and avoiding artificial constraints imposed by the test structure.  

3. **Local Infrastructure via Docker**  
   - Dependencies such as **databases, message queues, and caching layers** run in Docker to provide a real execution environment.  
   - This prevents issues that arise from mocking infrastructure that is **an integral part of the domain**.  

4. **Assertions at the Database Level Instead of Another API**  
   - Rather than testing against another public API, assertions are made at the **database level** to verify expected state changes. This approach avoids coupling tests to multiple endpoints, ensures tests remain independent, and allows validation even when there is no secondary API available.  
   - Additionally, higher-level integration and system tests will already cover **cross-endpoint** behavior, making such assertions redundant at this level.  

5. **Data-Driven Setup**  
   - Instead of **mocking repositories**, test data is inserted into the database to create setup conditions.  
   - Example: Before testing a `GET` request, relevant data is **manually seeded into the database** to ensure realistic test conditions.  

6. **Avoiding White-Box Test Structure Pitfalls**  
   - A common issue with white-box unit testing is that the test structure **mimics the project structure**—leading to a near 1:1 mapping between test classes and implementation classes. This results in unnecessary duplication and rigid test suites.  
   - This pragmatic approach avoids that problem by **organizing tests by behavior** rather than class structure, leaving flexibility to group tests in a way that makes sense for the domain.  
   - **Impact on Test Setup Structure**: Following this approach allows the test suite to be **structured around real-world scenarios and behaviors**, rather than being forced to mirror the internal architecture of the main codebase. This keeps the tests more **maintainable, expressive, and aligned with how the system is actually used**, rather than how it is implemented.

## **Advantages of This Approach**
✅ **High Confidence in System Behavior**  
By testing real components and interactions, this method avoids the **false sense of security** often associated with over-mocking.  

✅ **Catches Integration Issues Early**  
Internal services are tested **in context**, reducing the risk of integration failures only appearing in production.  

✅ **Minimal Refactoring Overhead**  
Tests are **less fragile** because they validate **outcomes rather than implementation details**.  

✅ **More Realistic Than Pure White-Box Unit Testing**  
Ensures that the system as a whole works as expected, rather than verifying only individual methods.  

✅ **Test Structure is Flexible**  
The test suite is **not bound** to the structure of the application, allowing for better organization and maintainability.  

## **When to Break the Convention**
While this unit testing approach is robust, there are cases where alternative strategies make more sense:

1. **Testing Edge Cases and Large Permutation Sets**  
   - If testing requires **dozens of permutations** (e.g., validation rules, calculation logic), isolated unit tests may be more efficient than API-driven tests.  
  
2. **Faster Feedback for Core Business Logic**  
   - Computationally heavy business logic (e.g., pricing calculations) can be **tested independently** in unit tests for rapid iteration.  
  
3. **Testing Behavior That Is Hard to Simulate in a Full System**  
   - Error handling, **time-sensitive workflows**, and **network failures** can often be tested more reliably with **targeted component tests**.  

4. **Performance and Load Testing**  
   - Unit tests are not designed for load testing. Tools like **Gatling or k6** are better suited for performance validation.  

## **Further Reading**
For a deeper discussion on why this approach works, we highly recommend:

- Ian Cooper’s talk ["TDD: Where Did It All Go Wrong?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM). It explores how TDD was originally intended to test behaviors rather than just isolated units of code, aligning closely with the pragmatic unit testing philosophy.
- Dan North’s article ["Introducing BDD"](https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/), which originally defined Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) as **outside-in testing**. Over time, however, BDD has become more associated with **Given-When-Then (GWT) syntax and tooling like Cucumber**, shifting the focus toward structured test descriptions rather than the underlying testing philosophy.

## **Conclusion**
This **pragmatic unit testing approach** provides a middle ground between **isolated unit testing and full end-to-end tests**, balancing **realism, maintainability, and execution speed**. By testing against a **single API endpoint** and asserting at system boundaries, this method delivers **high confidence in production readiness** without excessive fragility.

For teams struggling with **white-box unit tests** that mirror the code structure or overly coupled test suites, this approach offers a structured yet flexible alternative—one that maximizes **test effectiveness and system reliability** while keeping test suites maintainable.
