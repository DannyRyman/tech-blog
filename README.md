Ideas for posts:

## Not a fan of functional programming - are you sure?
How most mainstream languages are now hybrid, and devs might be using functional constructs without realising it.

## ORMs cause more harm than benefits. Typed SQL (JOOQ) is the sweet spot.

## You probably know more functional programming constructs than you think.
How the language around FP makes it sound more complex than it actually is (i.e. functor instead of mappable; monad instead of flatMap). Explain how thinking about concrete implementations of FP constructs (looking at the type signatures) is more productive than the generic constructs for most developers.

## TDD works better when it is not fine grained
Testing through the public API using real services leads to better outcomes than fine grained unit tests
